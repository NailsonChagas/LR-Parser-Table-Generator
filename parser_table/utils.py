def split_productions(productions: list[str]):
    """
    Splits the productions of a grammar into individual elements.

    For each production, the first element (p[0]) is the left-hand side of the production,
    and the remaining elements (p[1:]) are the right-hand side of the production.

    Args:
        productions (list[str]): List of strings representing the productions of the grammar.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing three elements:
            - List of lists, where each sublist represents a split production.
            - List of terminals present in the grammar.
            - List of variables (non-terminals) present in the grammar.
